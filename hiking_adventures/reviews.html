                “Beautiful view of the snake river, and doesn’t take too long to complete. There is a way to go which splits off from the main loop to go towards the top of the hill. The view from on top is gorgeous but going up and down is extremely steep, so come prepared to get a little dirty! Regardless, I would definitely go again!”<br>

                “It’s straight up for a while, but once you get to the top it is a great view to see the crater at the center. I would definitely say to take the trail which goes around the rim, it’s definitely worth it! Lots of good rocks to climb on and then you can see where the “r” actually is.”<br>

                “A really relaxing walk. Mostly paved at the beginning with some fun wooden bridges over parts of the river. Very relaxing once you get past the section by the freeway.”<br>
