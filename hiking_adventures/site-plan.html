      <h3>Hikes</h3>

Kelly Canyon Trail<br>
“Explore this 3.7-mile loop trail near Ririe, Idaho. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 1 h 42 min to complete. This is a popular trail for birding, hiking, and mountain biking, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. The best times to visit this trail are March through October. Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash.”<br>

Cress Creek Trail<br>
“Try this 1.3-mile loop trail near Ririe, Idaho. Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 41 min to complete. This is a popular trail for birding, hiking, and trail running, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. The best times to visit this trail are June through October. Dogs are welcome and may be off-leash in some areas.”<br>

Kelly Canyon Trail<br>
“Beautiful! Excellent views, strenuous exercise in parts, solitary (except for the cows!), and a great length for a casual hike.”<br>
-Aeryle Kuehn(on alltrails.com)<br>

Cress Creek Trail<br>
“Beautiful view of the snake river, and doesn’t take too long to complete. There is a way to go which splits off from the main loop to go towards the top of the hill. The view from on top is gorgeous but going up and down is extremely steep, so come prepared to get a little dirty! Regardless, I would definitely go again!”<br>
-Ben Davis<br>

Henry’s Fork Greenway<br>
“A really relaxing walk. Mostly paved at the beginning with some fun wooden bridges over parts of the river. Very relaxing once you get past the section by the freeway.”<br>
-Ben Davis<br>

Menan Butte<br>
“It’s straight up for a while, but once you get to the top it is a great view to see the crater at the center. I would definitely say to take the trail which goes around the rim, it’s definitely worth it! Lots of good rocks to climb on and then you can see where the “r” actually is.”<br>
